# About this interpreter

This interpreter isn't complete, but it is usable. It supports the s, k, i, ._x_ and v functions. The good part is that this interpreter can do abstraction elminimation, so you don't have to worry about it.

# Using this interpreter

To use this interpreter, run it with `java -jar Interpreter.jar -help`, and read more there.

Note: the terminal version is *VERY* slow.
